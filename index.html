        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi my name is Ajay Dhawan, and I’m currently a student completing
          my bachelor of engineering degree in<strong> software engineering</strong>.
          Software
          engineering excites me because I genuinely enjoy immersing myself
          in both individual and group projects, where I can truly put my
          skills to the test. Inspired early on by companies like Microsoft
          and Google, using computer technology to create and innovate has
          always been a huge passion of mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I was a child, I was extremely fascinated in learning about
          computer mechanisms, functions, and systems. This curiosity led to
          many technological projects I can proudly speak of today such as a
          Web scraper, CNC milling machine, and a general -purpose processor.
          Through the analytical, creativity, and problem-solving skills I
          have gained from working on these, I can confidently say that I’m
          ready for more. I’m interested in applying these skills at your
          company to design a movement of more efficient and productive
          processes.

              <p class="project-description">
                In grade 12, I was given the opportunity to lead a team project that was funded by our school
                to make a 3 axis CNC wood milling machine. My role in the team included being the project
                manager, software, and electronic specialist. The project in its entirety was constructed
                from scratch and took a total of approximately 3 months.
                <br>
                A CNC (Computer numerical control) machine is programmed code that sends instructions to a
                motor-controlled axis, which will then direct it to move precisely and cut or burn out a
                design that was made virtually. These machines take a virtually made object and bring them
                to life.
                <br><br>
                <strong><u>Design Process and Team Contribution:</u></strong>
                <br>
                As project manager, I took on the role of overseeing the project, which included creating
                deadlines, helping all other members with their parts, organizing resources and meetings and
                 much more.
                 <br><br>

                In regards to my sub-role of being the software and electronic specialist, my job was to design a
                circuit that controlled all three DC brushless motors with an Arduino. I first started out by designing
                 a circuit that was able to power the motors. I was able to find motor controllers online that already
                 existed for a low-cost and would be easy to incorporate for our design as shown in the image below.
                 After doing some research, I found a program that converted an STL file into g-code that could then
                 be translated into instructions. I then used Arduino and programmed it to read instructions, which
                 then allowed it to send signals to the motors. This enabled the motors to rotate at precise angles in
                 order to cut out the desired object.

            <h3 class="project-title">Web Scraper</h3>
            <p class="project-description">
              I took on this personal project in order to learn more about real-world applications of coding
              (i.e how to extract information that is contained on the web and save it in a json
              format that can be used to manipulate and save large amounts of data. This project
              was a small scale example of how python can extract data and save it into a data
              base.
              <br><br>
              The first part of my project was to access the
              url: (<a href="http://ethans_fake_twitter_site.surge.sh/">ethans fake twitter site</a>)
              and extract all of the information from the web page (“Scrape the website”).
              <br><br>
              This was done by using pythons’ request and beautifulsoup library. By using a for loop,
              I was able to add each individual tweet into a python dictionary with the key information
              such as author, date, tweet text, likes and shares. Then I proceeded to create a write JSON
              file where I archived all of the tweets into a JSON list. By doing this, I was able to create
              my own data base where the tweets could be searched through for information and or manipulated.
              The screen shot on the most left is the webscraper.py source code and on the right is the result
              of the collected data in JSON.
              <br><br>
              The second part of my project dealt with using the JSON data that was created in the first part.
              <br><br>
              With my first demonstration, I used two for loops to search through my data to find when Jimmy Fallon
              used the key words
              “Obama” and “thank you”. As you can see in the picture of the command prompt, the results returned that
              Jimmy Fallon had mentioned Obama 35 times and thank you notes 29 times. This demonstration was a proof of
              concept of how data can be taken from the web and phrased in such manner where the keyword information can be located.
	            <br><br>
              The second demonstration was about isolating all the dates that Jimmy Fallon had tweeted them and creating  a
              separate repository named Dates.json (as seen in the right picture) in order to log which days Jimmy Fallon had tweeted.

              4:16 Decoder and Finite State Machine (Control Unit) consists of two parts, the decoder and finite
              state machine. The purpose of the control unit is to cycle through different states that determines
              the operation that will be performed on the two 8-bit numbers.

              <br><br>
              The register/latch system (Control Unit) take 8-bit numbers in binary and temporarily store the input
              values on the rising edge. On the following rising edge, the numbers are passed through the following
             components in the system.

              <br><br>
              The arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) performs arithmetic and logical operations on two 8-bit numbers.
              The inputs are received by the registers (Latch 1 and Latch 2) which take the quantities and perform the
              function that is selected by the control unit.
              <br><br>
              Lastly, the 7 Segment (Output) displays the received output values from in decimal.
